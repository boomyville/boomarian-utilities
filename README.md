## Sound compressor

This Python script compresses audio files by increasing their speed using FFmpeg, which I developed to address time constraints in narrated video assignments. It processes .m4a, .mp3, and .wav files in the current directory, saving sped-up versions to a compressed_audio subdirectory. FFmpeg and Python 3.6+ are required. To use, place the script with audio files, run python3 sound_compressor.py, and find compressed files in the output directory. Customise the script's speed factor and file extensions to alter the compression speed and audio files.
